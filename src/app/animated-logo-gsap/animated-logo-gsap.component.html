<h2>SVG Animated With GSAP</h2>

<p>With the Greensock library we can unlock a whole number of advanced animation features that aren't available via CSS or Web Animations (which is what ngAnimate uses).</p>

<p>For example, we can morph shapes, as we do here with the polygon points.</p>


<svg viewBox="0 0 250 250">
  <svg:polygon #left class="left" points="125,30 125,30 125,30 31.9,63.2 46.1,186.3 125,230 125,230 125,230 203.9,186.3 218.1,63.2" />
  <svg:polygon #right class="right" points="125,30 125,52.2 125,52.1 125,153.4 125,153.4 125,230 125,230 203.9,186.3 218.1,63.2 125,30" />
